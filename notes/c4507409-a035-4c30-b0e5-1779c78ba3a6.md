# Data Structures Overview

## Arrays
- Contiguous memory allocation
- O(1) access time
- Fixed size in many languages
- Dynamic arrays (e.g., ArrayList in Java, List in C#) can resize automatically

## Linked Lists
- Non-contiguous memory allocation
- O(n) access time
- O(1) insertion/deletion at known positions
- Types: Singly linked, Doubly linked, Circular

## Stacks
- LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle
- Operations: push, pop, peek
- Applications: Function calls, Undo mechanisms, Expression evaluation

## Queues
- FIFO (First In, First Out) principle
- Operations: enqueue, dequeue, peek
- Applications: Job scheduling, Print spooling, Message queues

## Hash Tables
- Key-value pairs
- O(1) average case for insertion, deletion, lookup
- Collision resolution: Chaining, Open addressing
- Load factor affects performance

## Trees
- Hierarchical structure
- Binary trees, AVL trees, Red-Black trees, B-trees
- Tree traversals: Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, Level order

### Study Questions
1. Compare and contrast arrays vs. linked lists
2. When would you choose a hash table over a binary search tree?
3. Implement a stack using arrays and linked lists

**Note to self**: Prepare implementation examples for midterm project
